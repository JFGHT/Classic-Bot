# Classic Bot
Classic bot is a Chat client made to log in into the classic Battle.net, so you can speak with your friends without the need of Warcraft/Starcraft/Diablo game.

## Live example

## How does it work?
Classic bot is based in the [Alpha v3](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/static-assets.classic.blizzard.com/public/Chat+Bot+API+Alpha+v3.pdf) API.

You need an API Key. Here is how to get one:

>  Connect to Battle.net using StarCraft Remastered, Diablo 2 or Warcraft 3 and once in your preferred channel (Op or Clan) use the command /register-bot to start the registration process. An email is required to be registered to the account and after executing the command an email with activation link will be sent to the email on file. The user is required to click on the link to get a valid API Key. Executing the command a second time will issue a new API Key and invalidate the old key.

## Libraries used
ReactJS, NextJS, Redux, Reactstrap, react-chat-elements, classic-bnet-javascript-api.
